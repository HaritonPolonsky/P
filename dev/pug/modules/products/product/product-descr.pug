                "If you suffer from joint pain you’re not alone. According to a National Health Interview Survey over a 30-day period,30 percent of adults experienced pain,aching or stiffness in or around a joint.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 54.4 million American adults—about 15 percent of the population—suffer from arthritis,the inflammation of one or more joints.Joints,the physical point of connection between bones,provide support and generally facilitate movement.There are 360 joints in the body,most of which are movable.When healthy,bones within a joint glide smoothly past each other because their surfaces are covered with a smooth layer of cartilage and a membrane that secretes a lubricating liquid called synovial fluid.",
                "Dysfunction and pain occur when either synovial fluid doesn’t secrete properly or the cartilage covering bones deteriorates. Damage can happen suddenly or gradually and may be caused by diseases or injury. The pain and swelling can be acute or chronic and range from mild to severe. Osteoarthritis,the deterioration of the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones (especially in the knees and hips) that frequently occurs as a natural part of aging,is the most common cause of joint pain.Rheumatoid arthritis,an autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system attacks the membranes that secrete synovial fluid,is another common cause of joint pain along with gout,lupus and fibromyalgia. While your first line of defense may be over-the-counter pain medication (ibuprofen, acetaminophen or aspirin), such products can have serious side effects, like kidney damage. Fortunately, there are numerous natural ways to reduce inflammation and alleviate the discomfort caused by joint pain.")
